# FastAPI Redis Microservices

Microservices backend using FastAPI, RedisJSON for persistence, and Redis Streams for event-driven communication. This project includes:

- 📦 **Inventory Service** – for managing product data (name, price, quantity)
- 💳 **Payment Service** – for processing purchases with markup and order tracking
- 💾 **RedisJSON** – used for storing product and order data
- 🔁 **Redis Streams** – used for asynchronous, event-driven communication between services

This setup does not include a frontend and focuses purely on backend logic, async processing, and microservice decoupling.
